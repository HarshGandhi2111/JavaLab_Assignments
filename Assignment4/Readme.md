The Card class has default and parameterized constructors to create cards with specific ranks and suits.
The Card class has private data members to store the rank and suit of each card.
The Card class has methods to create a deck of cards, print a card, print the entire deck, compare two cards, sort the deck, and find a specific card in the deck.
The DeckOfCards class provides a menu-driven interface to interact with a deck of cards. The program allows you to:

Print the entire deck of cards.
Print a specific card by rank and suit.
Sort the deck of cards.

<h3>Arithmetic Operations on Rational Numbers with Arithmetic Exception</h3>
The RationalNumber class is a Java program that represents rational numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations on them. It takes four integers as input, which are the numerators and denominators of two rational numbers, and then creates objects of the RationalNumber class to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, and absolute value. The program also includes methods to get the numerator, denominator, and decimal value of a rational number.

The program ensures that the denominator of a rational number is not zero, and reduces the fraction to its simplest form by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The program uses private helper functions to calculate the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers.

<h4>Usage</h4>
To use the program, compile and run the RationalNumber.java file in a Java development environment or execute the compiled class file from the command line. When running the program, provide four integers as input arguments in the following order: numerator and denominator of the first rational number, followed by the numerator and denominator of the second rational number.

<h4>Output</h4>
The program will output the rational numbers provided as input, perform the specified arithmetic operations, and display the results on the console. The results of arithmetic operations are also RationalNumber objects, which can be used to perform further operations or obtain their numerator and denominator values.

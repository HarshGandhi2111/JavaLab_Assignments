This program creates a Student class that describes attributes of a student like PRN, Name, Date of Birth, and Marks. 
It then creates an arraylist of objects of the Student class and performs operations like adding students, displaying all students, searching for a student by PRN, name or position, updating a student, and deleting a student. 
The program is menu-driven, meaning the user selects an option from a list of options presented to them.

## Student Management

This program is designed to demonstrate various concepts in Java such as classes, array of objects/arraylist, instance members, and constructors. It creates a Student class that describes attributes of a student such as PRN, Name, Date of Birth, and Marks.

The program uses a menu-driven approach, where the user can select from a list of options to perform operations such as adding students, displaying all students, searching for a student by PRN, name or position, updating a student, and deleting a student.

Here's a brief description of the operations that can be performed in this program:

1. Add Student: The user can add a new student by entering their PRN, Name, Date of Birth, and Marks. The program then adds the new student to the arraylist.

2. Display Students: The program displays all students in the arraylist.

3. Search by PRN: The user can search for a student by entering their PRN. If the student is found, their details are displayed.

4. Search by Name: The user can search for a student by entering their name. If one or more students with the same name are found, their details are   displayed.

5. Search by Position: The user can search for a student by entering their position in the arraylist. If the position is valid, the details of the student at that position are displayed.

6. Update/Edit: The user can update the details of a student by entering their PRN. If the student is found, the user can enter new values for their Name, Date of Birth, and Marks.

7. Delete: The user can delete a student by entering their PRN.

To run this program, simply compile and run the Main class. The program will display a menu of options, and the user can select the desired option by entering a number.

Overall, this program is a good example of how to use classes and arraylists in Java, and how to implement a menu-driven interface for performing operations on objects.
